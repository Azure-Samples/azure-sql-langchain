Query and modify data effectively with the latest T-SQL features

Master Transact-SQL's fundamentals, and write correct, robust code for querying and modifying data with modern Microsoft data technologies, including SQL Server 2022, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Managed Instance. Long-time Microsoft Data Platform MVP Itzik Ben-Gan explains key T-SQL concepts, helping you apply your knowledge with hands-on exercises. Ben-Gan first introduces T-SQL's theory and underlying logic, illuminating it as both a language and a way of thinking. Next, he walks through core topics, including logical query processing, single table queries, joins, subqueries, table expressions, set operators, data analysis, data modifications, temporal tables, and transactions and concurrency. Building on this foundation, you'll enhance your coding capabilities, from programmatic constructs to the powerful new SQL Graph. Throughout, Ben-Gan presents reusable T-SQL sample code that works in cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments.
